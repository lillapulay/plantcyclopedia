## About
Pokemon app created with vanilla JavaScript and styled with CSS as part of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development course.
This simple app loads data from an external API, displays each object on a separate button and shows further details in a modal.

The goal of this project was to learn basic JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, DOM interaction, AJAX, etc.) in the beginning of the course. To see the hosted website, click [here](https://lillapulay.github.io/pokedex-javascript/). 

After this exercise I created an updated version using Bootstrap and jQuery, which can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/lillapulay/jquery-pokedex).

## Planned updates:
- [x] Styling updates (background, modal, favicon, font)
- [x] Use different background images on L and S screens
- [ ] Search bar, possibly a 'sort' function
- [ ] 'Back to top' button
- [ ] Loading indicator
- [ ] Error handling and error messages (e.g. offline mode)
- [ ] Hamburger menu on M and S screens
- [ ] Replace logo
- [ ] Scrollbar
- [ ] Hide button outline
